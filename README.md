# Regression-DS

We do two main things. The first thing, research the data and present the analysis in a representative way. The second thing, create a regression model that knew how to predict the price of the cars with the variables/features. This will be used by sellers to understand exactly how prices change with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc. to
meet certain price levels. Furthermore, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
